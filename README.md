# Employ_track

link to deployed site:

For this project we needed to add into the starter code and complete it in order for the user to add in employees information and then repeat the process until complete and then display the information.

skills implemented: java script

To the best of my ability, I used certain methods to get the desired outcome. Adding click events and implementing functions and creating arrays to collect the employee information.

Lessons learned:
Definitely still struggling with java script just having issues figuring out what proper methods and techniques need to be implemented in order to get the disired outcome. It just seems like I'll get the majority of what is needed but I'm either missing a couple pieces in order to make it work correctly or its just in the wrong place and needs to get reordered.
